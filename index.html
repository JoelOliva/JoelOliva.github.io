The World Health Organization (WHO) compiles data about the countries in the world.
This investigation focuses on data with regards to tuberculosis incidents in each country.
Specifically, treatment success rate and the cohort size are the variables of interest
and inferences are made using this data. The investigation is narrowed down to consider
only 10 countries from WHO, all of which are chosen using a random sampling method.

The investigation can be broken up into four different parts. The first part focuses mainly
on gathering, compiling, and organizing the data. The second part looks at finding the true
proportion of tuberculosis treatment for some of the countries. The third part considers
center, spread, and outliers in the data set. Finally the last part focuses on computing
probabilities based on the data. Some techniques used include random sampling,
confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, quantifying data (mean, median, outliers, etc.)
graphing (box plot, histogram, etc.) through the use of external tools, basic probability
(addition, multiplication, and complement rules, etc.).

			The main thing I learned as a result of this assignment is that there are many things that can be inferred about data even when only looking at two variables but also how to work with real world data. Apart from this assignment the only exposure to using statistical skills were on contrived examples through doing homework assignments and quizzes. I feel that working with real world data and deriving statistics based on that kinda drives home how these skills can be applied to answering real questions or at the very least estimating the likelihood of certain situations.

			I think overall this assignment changed the way I think about real-world math applications. The main focus of this assignment was performing a statistical analysis and deriving a conclusion based on that. This is something that's completely different from the real-world applications of other math classes at least the ones I've taken so far. The main difference being that statistics at it's core feels like it leans more on inductive reasoning rather than deductive reasoning. I think a interesting comparison would be that of working towards a verdict in court case. What I mean by this is that from my limited understanding of the court system, generally a verdict is given only through a thorough analysis of events, witness testimonials, and accepted evidence. First off, the defendant has the advantage in a court trial since the burden of proof always falls on the prosecutor. Secondly, in order for the prosecutor to overcome the burden proof it is not necessary to show that someone is guilty with absolute certainty, it's only necessary to convince the jury that someone is guilty by presenting a strong enough case. This is similar to how accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis works, in the case of a hypothesis test we need enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis although that won't make our conclusion true necessarily.

			To summarize the parallels between the two; In a statistical investigation we start by asking question which we will later answer (is someone guilty?). Then we design a study (civil case, criminal case, juvenile case) and collect relevant data (finding evidence, gathering witnesses). Third, we perform a statistical analysis such as a hypothesis test (the court trial). Finally, we make inferences in context such as whether or not we accept or reject the null hypothesis (the verdict). Now, the court system isn't exactly one-to-one with a statistical investigation but I think they are similar enough to be an interesting comparison. To conclude, this assignment really let me see a different side of math, specifically in real-world applications.
